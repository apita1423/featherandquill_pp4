## Introduction

- Feather and Quill is my fourth project with Code Insitute. The idea for Feather and Quill came from my love for birds and books. I wanted to create a blog that will showcase the various topics between birds and books. It is a place where users can receive recommendations on books (mostly about birds), tips on bird watching, gallery of pictures that were taken, and events (future development).
---

## User Experience

### Project Goals

- Feather and Quill's goal was to create a place where users would be able to access content through blog posts about various book reviews (especially about birds), tips on bird watching for seasoned birders and beginners. Feather and Quill would also be a place where bird enthusiasts can have a conversation through comments and the possibiltiy to add pictures of their birding adventures. 

### Target Audience
- The target audience for Feather and Quill is anyone who is passionate about bird watching and literature.

## User Stories

Not all user stories have been implemented. They have been left for future implementations.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

- I wanted the colours of the site to be simple, clean, and light. I only used one colour for the buttons and footer.

### Typography

- Estonia font from [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/?query=estonia) has been used for the Feather and Quill title.

### Imagery

- Images have been obtained from Pexel, Unsplash, Gencraft (AI), Simon & Schuster Publsihing, and Little, Brown and Company Publishing.

- All images will be credited in the [Media](#media) section.

### Wireframes

- I used Balsamiq for the wireframes for this project. At the time of creating them, I had grandieous ideas, but due to my leave of absence and limited time to create all the ideas I wanted, not everything was implemented. I tried to get as close to the original idea, but it will be a great tool to have for future updates.

### Database Relationship Schema

## Features

### General Features

### Future Implementation

1. An events/booking page where visitors to the page can view the events, but would not be able to book unless they are authenticated. Authenticated users can view the events and book for the event. 
2. Authicated users would be able to comment anonoymously to blog posts.
3. A newsletter that can be set to authenticated user about events happening in the month, which helps if they are not on the site often.
