## Introduction
Feather and Quill is my fourth project with Code Insitute. The idea for Feather and Quill came from my love for birds and books. I wanted to create a blog that will showcase the various topics between birds and books. It is a place where you could receive recommendations on books (mostly about birds), tips on bird watching, gallery of pictures that were taken, and events (future development).
